# Homeless Shelter HMIS Web App – Full Build Specification (Mobile-First, FY 2026 Compliant)

## 1. Project Overview & Guiding Principles

This system is designed specifically for small-to-medium nonprofit shelters that need a lightweight, high-performance alternative to "enterprise-bloat" HMIS software. Our mission is to reduce the administrative burden on front-line staff so they can focus on what truly matters: supporting people in crisis. By prioritizing a mobile-first approach, we empower staff to perform intakes and check-ins directly on the floor or in the field, rather than being tethered to a desktop.

The primary users are shelter staff and volunteers who may have varying levels of technical proficiency and are often operating in high-stress, fast-paced environments. High staff turnover is a reality in this sector, so the UI must be "pick-up-and-play" intuitive, requiring minimal training.

Our core values are **Privacy, Dignity, and Compliance**. We adhere strictly to the **FY 2026 HUD HMIS Data Standards** (effective Oct 2025). This means we've moved away from outdated demographic collection—specifically noting the removal of "Gender" as a standalone category in favor of the current "Sex" and "Gender Identity" requirements—ensuring data is collected with trauma-informed sensitivity.

Finally, we recognize that shelter work happens in real-time. This system prioritizes a "Bed Board" that functions as the heartbeat of the app, providing instant visibility into capacity to ensure no one is turned away due to bad data.

## 2. Recommended Tech Stack & Why

* **Frontend:** **React (with Vite)** + **Tailwind CSS**. React offers a component-based architecture perfect for reusable forms; Tailwind ensures the UI is responsive and lightweight for mobile browsers.
* **Backend:** **Node.js (Express)** or **Supabase (BaaS)**. For a low-budget nonprofit, Supabase is the "Goldilocks" choice: it provides a PostgreSQL database, built-in Auth, and instant Realtime listeners for bed updates with zero DevOps overhead.
* **Database:** **PostgreSQL**. The relational nature of HUD data (Clients linked to Households linked to Enrollments) requires the strict schema and ACID compliance of Postgres.
* **Auth & Realtime:** **Supabase Auth** (Role-Based Access Control) + **Postgres Changes**. This allows the Bed Board to update automatically when a client is checked in by another staff member.
* **Deployment:** **Vercel** (Frontend) + **Supabase** (Database/Backend). Both offer generous free tiers and "Pro" tiers starting at $20/mo, making this extremely budget-friendly.

## 3. Core Data Model (Entities & Relationships)

The data model follows a relational flow to maintain historical records while tracking current stays.

**Key Entities:**

* **Clients:** Name, DOB, SSN (Encrypted), Race, Ethnicity, Sex (FY26 Standard).
* **Households:** A grouping entity to link clients (Primary Applicant + Members).
* **Enrollments:** Maps a Client to a Project. Stores "Entry Date," "Exit Date," and "Disability Status."
* **Bed_Inventory:** Physical units/beds available in the shelter.
* **Bed_Assignments:** Links an Enrollment to a specific Bed for a specific duration.
* **Services:** Tracked events (e.g., "Bus Pass," "Case Management Session").

**Relationship Logic:**
`Client` (1) — (N) `Enrollment` (1) — (1) `Bed_Assignment`
`Household` (1) — (N) `Client`

## 4. Essential Modules & Detailed Specs

### Module 1: Dashboard & Real-Time Bed Board

* **Purpose:** Provide an instant snapshot of shelter capacity and today's expected check-ins/outs.
* **Key HUD Data:** Project Type (Emergency Shelter), Bed Type (Emergency).
* **Workflow:** 1. Staff opens app → 2. Views "Available Beds" card → 3. Taps a bed to see occupant details or assign a new client.
* **Mobile UI/UX:** Grid view of beds. Green = Empty, Red = Occupied. Large "Quick Check-in" button.
* **Edge Case:** Client walks in at 2 AM; staff needs to assign a bed immediately without completing a full 20-page intake. (Solution: Allow "Partial Intake" saved as a draft).

### Module 2: Search & Global Intake

* **Purpose:** Prevent duplicate records and collect Universal Data Elements (UDEs).
* **Key HUD Data:** Name, DOB, SSN (last 4), Race, Ethnicity, Veteran Status.
* **Workflow:** 1. Search by Name/DOB → 2. If no match, "Create New" → 3. Collect HUD UDEs.
* **Mobile UI/UX:** Single-column form. Use native date pickers for DOB.
* **Edge Case:** Client has a common name. (Solution: System displays DOB and Last 4 of SSN in search results to differentiate).

### Module 3: Household Management

* **Purpose:** Grouping family members together for a single enrollment.
* **Key HUD Data:** Relationship to Head of Household (HoH).
* **Workflow:** 1. Select HoH → 2. Search/Add members → 3. Define relationships.
* **Mobile UI/UX:** "Family Tree" style list with "Add Member" icon.
* **Edge Case:** Household members arrive on different nights. (Solution: Allow adding members to an existing "Active" household enrollment).

### Module 4: Enrollment & Entry Assessment

* **Purpose:** Capture the "snapshot" of a client's life upon entry (HUD Requirement).
* **Key HUD Data:** Prior Living Situation, Length of Stay in Previous Place, Disabling Condition.
* **Workflow:** 1. Start Enrollment → 2. Answer HUD-required questions → 3. Select Project.
* **Mobile UI/UX:** Progress bar at the top; "Save & Continue Later" button is prominent.
* **Edge Case:** Client is fleeing domestic violence. (Solution: Trigger "Privacy Flag" which hides location details and restricts record visibility).

### Module 5: Bed & Unit Inventory

* **Purpose:** Manage the physical layout of the shelter (Rooms, Bunks, Mats).
* **Key Data:** Unit Name, Bed Number, Availability Status, Gender-specific designation (if applicable).
* **Workflow:** 1. Admin creates Room → 2. Adds Bunks → 3. Marks bed as "Out of Service" for maintenance.
* **Mobile UI/UX:** Toggle switches for "Active/Inactive" status.
* **Edge Case:** A bed is broken. (Solution: Mark as "Maintenance" to remove from available count without deleting the record).

### Module 6: Service Entry & Case Notes

* **Purpose:** Track non-housing support provided to clients.
* **Key HUD Data:** Service Date, Service Type (e.g., Financial, Health, Food).
* **Workflow:** 1. Select Client → 2. Select Service Type → 3. Add timestamped Case Note.
* **Mobile UI/UX:** Voice-to-text enabled text areas for case notes.
* **Edge Case:** Staff needs to record a service for a whole family. (Solution: "Bulk Apply" checkbox for all household members).

### Module 7: Exit Assessment

* **Purpose:** Capture outcomes to measure shelter performance.
* **Key HUD Data:** Exit Date, Destination (e.g., Rental with Subsidy, Street), Reason for Leaving.
* **Workflow:** 1. Select Active Enrollment → 2. Enter Exit Date → 3. Select Destination from HUD dropdown.
* **Mobile UI/UX:** Dropdown menus optimized for thumb-tapping.
* **Edge Case:** Client disappears (no-show). (Solution: "Data Not Collected" option for Destination per HUD standards).

### Module 8: Consent & Privacy Tracking

* **Purpose:** Manage ROI (Release of Information) and HIPAA/HUD privacy compliance.
* **Key Data:** Consent Granted (Y/N), Start Date, Expiration Date.
* **Workflow:** 1. Present digital ROI to client → 2. Client signs (stylus/finger) → 3. System unlocks record for sharing.
* **Mobile UI/UX:** Digital signature pad component.
* **Edge Case:** Client withdraws consent. (Solution: Immediate "Global Lock" on record, making it viewable only by the creating agency).

## 5. Page-by-Page UI Structure (Mobile-First)

* `/dashboard`: High-level metrics (Total Beds, Occupancy %, Today's In/Out).
* `/clients`: Searchable list with "Add New" FAB (Floating Action Button).
* `/clients/:id`: Profile view with tabs for (Info, Enrollments, Services, Files).
* `/bed-board`: Visual map of the shelter. Red/Green color coding.
* `/reports`: Simple buttons to export "Daily Roster" or "HUD APR" (CSV/PDF).
* `/settings`: User profile, Dark Mode toggle, Agency info.

---

## 6. Security, Privacy & Compliance Notes

* **Encryption:** All PII (SSNs, DOBs) must be encrypted at rest using AES-256. Supabase handles transit encryption via SSL/TLS.
* **FY 2026 Audit:** Maintain an `audit_log` table that records every "View" and "Edit" action with a timestamp and UserID.
* **Role-Based Access (RBAC):** - *Admin:* Full access + User management.
* *Staff:* Intake, Bed assignments, Case notes.
* *Volunteer:* View-only bed board, check-in/out only.


* **Data Minimization:** If your project doesn't require SSNs for funding, don't collect them. Use a "Client ID" instead.
